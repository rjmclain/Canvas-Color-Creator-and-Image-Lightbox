# Canvas-Color-Creator-and-Image-Lightbox
These are examples for a color creator to use with the canvas,
which creates a new color and adds it to a list of colors to select from when drawing on a canvas.

The photos html page is a simple lightbox for viewing photos.

Both use very simple styling and jQuery.
